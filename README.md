# Restaurant Ordering System

## Description
This project is a C++ console application that simulates a simple restaurant ordering system. The program allows users to view a menu, select food items, enter quantities, and calculate the total cost of their order. The project focuses on clean code structure, user input handling, and modular program design.

## Features
- Display a restaurant menu with prices
- Allow users to order multiple items
- Calculate the total bill based on selected items and quantities
- Validate user input for menu selection and quantity
- Clear and user-friendly console output

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Input/Output
- Conditional statements
- Loops and functions
- Structs for menu data

## How to Run
1. Compile the program: g++ main.cpp -o restaurant_ordering
2. Run the program: ./restaurant_ordering

## Example
**Menu:**
- Burger – $8.50  
- Pizza – $10.00  
- Pasta – $9.25  

**User selects:**
- Burger (2)
- Pizza (1)

**Output:**
- Total cost: $27.00

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using structs to organize data
- Improved handling of loops and conditionals
- Applied real-world logic in a C++ program
- Strengthened code readability and modular design
